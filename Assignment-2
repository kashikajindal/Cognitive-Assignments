#iii. WAP to sort L in ascending order.

#2. Create a tuple of marks scored as scores = (45, 89.5, 76, 45.4, 89, 92, 58, 45) andperform the following operations using tuple functions:

#i. Identify the highest score and its index in the tuple
print(max(tuple))

#ii. Find the lowest score and count how many times it appears
print(min(tuple))
print(tuple.index(min(tuple)))
#iii. Reverse the tuple and return it as a list. 
print(list(tuple[::-1]))
#iv. Check if a specific score ‚Äò76‚Äô (input by the user) is present in the tuple and print its first occurrence index, or a message saying it‚Äôs not present.

#4. Consider the following two sets, A and B, represening scores of two teams in mul∆üple matches. A = {34, 56, 78, 90} and B = {78, 45, 90, 23} WAP to perform the following opera∆üons using set funcions:

C=A.union(B)

#ii. Idenify the scores that are common to both teams (intersec∆üon of sets).
D=A.intersection(B)
print(D)
#iii. Find the scores that are exclusive to each team (symmetric difference).
E=A.symmetric_difference(B)
print(E)
#iv. Check if the scores of team A are a subset of team B, and if team B's scores are a superset of team A. 
print(A.issubset(B))

#v. Remove a specific score ùëã (input by the user) from set A if it exists. If not, print a message saying it is not present.

#5. Write a program to rename a key city to a loca∆üon in the following dictionary.
sample_dict = {
